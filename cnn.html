    <h1 class="mt-4">Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h1>
    <p>
      CNN, which stands for Convolutional Neural Network, is a type of deep learning algorithm widely used in computer vision tasks. It is designed to mimic the visual processing abilities of the human brain and has revolutionized the field of image recognition and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      CNNs are particularly effective at detecting and recognizing patterns in images, making them invaluable in various applications such as object detection, image classification, and facial recognition.

    <p>
      The key feature of CNNs is their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual data. They achieve this through a series of interconnected layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image, extracting local features and preserving spatial relationships. Pooling layers downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while maintaining the important information. Finally, fully connected layers perform classification or regression based on the extracted features.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reasons for the success of CNNs is their ability to learn feature hierarchies directly from the data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. By training on large labeled datasets, CNNs can learn to recognize complex patterns and generalize well to unseen examples.
